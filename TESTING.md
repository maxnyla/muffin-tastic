The aim of Muffin-Tastic is to provide an inspiring array of muffin recipes, and allow anyone to create an account for free so that they can also add their 
own recipes to the site. Once they have registered an account they will be able to add recipes, edit them and delete them.

This website has been tested through the GTMetrix site, [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com).
Below is a screenshot of the results achieved for each page. Page speed score was and the time to fully load the site was

## Code validation <a name="codeval"></a>

I ran all my code through the  [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org), the [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) and the [PEP8 Validation] (http://pep8online.com/).

The CSS validator resulted in three errors: one invalid font-weight value which was 350 and I changed to 300 as a result of the validator, and two
incorrect font styling options for the muffin card names that I had set to incorrectly use emphasize. Since these were not being applied as they were incorrect, I simply removed them from my code
and the validation was then successful.

The PEP8 code validator gave me a few indentation errors and lines that were too long so I fixed all these before saving the files again and the code passed 
this time, after the changes.

I have also used the Chrome Developer Tools extensively throughout the project. They have been very useful for each change that I made, and to double-check my ideas before implementing them.

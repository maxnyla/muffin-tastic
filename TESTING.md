The aim of Muffin-Tastic is to provide an inspiring array of muffin recipes, and allow anyone to create an account for free so that they can also add their 
own recipes to the site. Once they have registered an account they will be able to add recipes, edit them and delete them.

## Browser Compatibility <a name="browsercomp"></a>


## Code validation <a name="codeval"></a>

I ran all my code through the  [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org), the [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) and the [JSHint Javascript Validator](https://jshint.com/)


I have also used the Chrome Developer Tools extensively throughout the project. They have been very useful for each change that I made, and to double-check my ideas before implementing them.

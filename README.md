The aim of Muffin-Tastic is to provide an inspiring array of muffin recipes, and allow anyone to create an account for free so that they can also add their 
own recipes to the site. Once users have have registered a (free) account they will be able to add recipes to the site, edit them and delete them if they so wish.
Users are also able to delete their account which will delete the muffins from the site as well.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This site has been built as the Milestone Project number 3 for my Code Institute software development diploma. 

One of the main goals of the project is to create a full stack site which displays the CRUD principles: Create, Read, Update and Delete. Users need to be able to not only view data and have
interactions with the site, but also be able to add their own data (in the form of recipes) and later on update and delete it if they so wish.

## UX <a name="ux"></a>




 **Logo and header**


- The logo is 


 **Navigation**


 **Home page**


**Register page**


**Log In/Log Out page**


**My Account page**


**Add Recipe page**


**My Muffins page**



## Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

All the wireframes were created with [Microsoft Paint](https://jspaint.app/).

I created two wireframes for each page: one home page for the mobile view and another for the desktop view, and the same for the game page. 



* The wireframes can be found here:

## Visual Identity <a name="visualidentity"></a>

I used LogoMakr to design the logo. 


### Site overview <a name="siteoverview"></a>

Below are a series of images taken which show an overview of all the pages on the site and their different stages:

**Home page:**

For the purpose of improving user experience, I have compressed the images using [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) 

As can be seen below, the total reduction in image size on this site has been of % (MB).

**Testing/Building the site**

The full testing process for this project can be found [here](TESTING.md).



## Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

**Deployment**

This website has been deployed to Heroku as [Muffin-Tastic](https://muffin-tastic.herokuapp.com/).

It was deployed ahead of time and modified on a number of occasions so that I would be able to check how things worked on different devices, and to ask others to test it themselves. 


The process for deployment is documented below:

## Technologies <a name="technologies"></a>


For this project I have used the below technologies:

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) for the build of the site

- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) for the styling

- [Javascript](https://jquery.com) for the interactive elements of the site, to initialize the Materialize elements that rtequired it.

- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io)
    Since I am typing this text through Gitpod, I figured it would go first in the list. All code was created through Gitpod and the workspace for this project resides there.

- [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
    This has been used to host the project.

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
    This has been used to deploy the project.

- [MongoDB](https://www.github.com)
    This has been used to host the database.

- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com)
    Used as a framework for their grid system, navbars, forms, etc. I have also on many occasions modified the initial system for styling purposes.

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com)
    Used for the cup icon, which I have used on both pages.

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) 
    Used for the scripts

- [Code Beautify CSS beautifier](https://codebeautify.org)
    Used to make my CSS look nicer and tidier

- [Beautify Tools HTML beautifier](http://beautifytools.com/html-beautifier.php)
    Used to make my HTML tidier 

- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org)
    Used to check my HTML code
    
- [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator)
    Used to check my CSS code


I have also used the Chrome Developer Tools extensively throughout the project. They have been very useful for each change that I made, and to double-check my ideas before implementing them.

## Media <a name="media"></a>

I have taken advantage of several useful resources for images and my logo. Please see below:

- [Logo Makr](https://logomakr.com/) 
    for the logo design

- [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/) 
    I used this for the images

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/6?next=%2Fstart) 
    for the icons used on this project

- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) 
    for the image used in the UX section showing the different screen sizes.

- [Favicon](https://www.favicon.io)
    for the thumbnail icon on the internet tab header
